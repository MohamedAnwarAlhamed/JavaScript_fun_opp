/*
  To Understand Ajax, Fetch, Promises

  Asynchronous vs Synchronous Programming
  - Meaning

  Synchronous
  - Operations Runs in Sequence
  - Each Operation Must Wait For The Previous One To Complete
  - Story From Real Life

  Asynchronous
  - Operations Runs In Parallel
  - This Means That An Operation Can Occur while Another One Is Still Being Processed
  - Story From Real Life

  - Facebook As Example
  - Simulation

  Search
  - JavaScript Is A Single-Threaded
  - Multi Threaded Languages
*/

// Synchronous

// console.log("1");
// console.log("2");
// window.alert("Operation");
// console.log("3");

// Asynchronous
console.log("1");
console.log("2");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Operation"), 3000);

  Call Stack || Stack Trace
  -- JavaScript Engine Uses A Call Stack To Manage Execution Contexts
  -- Mechanism To Make The Interpreter Track Your Calls
  -- When Function Called It Added To The Stack
  -- When Function Executed It Removed From The Stack
  -- After Function Is Finished Executing The Interpreter Continue From The Last Point
  -- Work Using LIFO Principle => Last In First Out
  -- Code Execution Is Synchronous.
  -- Call Stack Detect Web API Methods And Leave It To The Browser To Handle It

  Web API
  -- Methods Available From The Environment => Browser

  Event Loop + Callback Queue

  Story
  - JavaScript Is A Single Threaded Language "All Operations Executed in Single Thread"
  - Call Stack Track All Calls
  - Every Function Is Done Its Poped Out
  - When You Call Asynchronous Function It Sent To Browser API
  - Asynchronous Function Like Settimeout Start Its Own Thread
  - Browser API Act As A Second Thread
  - API Finish Waiting And Send Back The Function For Processing
  - Browser API Add The Callback To Callback Queue
  - Event Loop Wait For Call Stack To Be Empty
  - Event Loop Get Callback From Callback Queue And Add It To Call Stack
  - Callback Queue Follow FIFO "First In First Out" Rule
